# Diplomado Compumaestro 2.0
This program was offered to teachers in three cohorts, with up to three groups per cohort. Each teacher was provided a modern laptop equipped with all the necessary tools and software for the curriculum, which included:

* Authoring tools
* AR tools
* Special browsers for children with disabilities
* LMS
* Office Suite
* Scratch
* ...and many more topics.

The primary goal was to promote the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into the teaching-learning process. We achieved this by providing technology to teachers who committed to using it in their classrooms, which were then followed up.

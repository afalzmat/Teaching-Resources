# Lego EV3, WeDo, and Scratch Clubs

These clubs were created to normalize robotics and programming in public schoolsâ€”a privilege often limited to private institutions. Our long-term goal was to foster a STEM mentality with the future aim of introducing makerspaces. We successfully organized and celebrated inter-school and inter-district competitions and exchanges against all odds.

Robotics and Scratch were the main topics tailored specifically to engage girls.

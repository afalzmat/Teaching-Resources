# MultiPoint for Teachers

The Ministry of Education of the Dominican Republic (MINERD) had been equiping schools with labs, offices and library spaces with stations setup in a LAN using thin clients and the Microsoft MultiPoint OS.

Due to the need of training on taking the advantages offered by this tech to integrate it to the teaching-learning process, this workshop was prepared and then successfully taught in several schools such as:
* Polit√©cnico de Bani,
* Escuela Los Quemados en Paya,
* Liceo Juan Bosch en Rio Arriba,
* Escuela Rafael Crousset en Matanzas,
* Liceo Ernestina Tejeda,
* among others.

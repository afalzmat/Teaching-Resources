# MultiPoint for Teachers Workshop Handout

This is the handout used for workshops taught in several schools registered for the Ministry of Education of the Dominican Republic's 03-04 Educational District in the Peravia province.

The goal of these workshops and, of course, this handout as well, was to demonstrate the advantages, train and motivate the integration, of this tech to the teaching-learning process.
